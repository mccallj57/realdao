**Severance and Tokenization Agreement of {HEADER}**

**THIS SEVERANCE AND TOKENIZATION AGREEMENT OF {HEADER}** (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is made and entered into effective as of {EFFECTIVEDATE} (&quot;Effective Date&quot;), by and between the owner represented at Account Address {OWNERADDRESS} (&quot;Owner&quot;) of real, tangible or personal property, and {HOLDER} (&quot;Holder&quot;) represented at Account Address {HOLDERADDRESS}. Owner and Holder are referred to collectively below as the &quot;Parties.&quot;

**WHEREAS** , Owner is the owner of that certain tangible, personal or real property commonly known as the {PROPERTYDESCRIPTION} (&quot;Real Property&quot;); and

**WHEREAS** , Holder and Owner desire to constructively sever and treat as personal property (&quot;Severed Property&quot;); and

**WHEREAS** , Holder and Owner desires to mint cryptographic tokens to manage and represent certain rights, ownership and control over the Severed Property (&quot;Severed Property Token&quot;); and

**WHEREAS** , Holder desires to transfer ownership of the Severed Property Token to the Holder; and

**WHEREAS** , Holder desires to obtain license to {LICENSELANG}; and

**NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby:

1. Agree that the Severed Property typically considered a fixture or otherwise real property, is considered severed by this agreement and shall be considered personal property until which time the Option to repurchase is exercised and Severed Property merges back with the Real Property,
2. Consent that the {TOKEN} will be minted and the parties will defer to this agreement to govern and manage the Severed Property using the Severed Property Token,
3. Consent to the License from the Owner to the Holder to access Severed Property, and
4. Agree that upon payment of a liquidated amount of {LIQUIDATEDAMOUNT}, the Holder shall grant said Owner the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase Severed Property at any time thereby revoking the License and this Agreement (the &quot;Option&quot;). For avoidance of doubt, Severed Property would resume its state as a fixture and cosntructively merge and become part and parcel to the Real Property upon exercise of this Option.

**Revocable License**
Grant of Revocable License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Owner hereby grants to Holder a revocable license for the Term of this Agreement to use that portion of Real Property shown on the Site Plan for the sole use of traversing the Real Property {LICENSELANG} to use, enjoy, or harvest Severed Property. It is specifically determined that Holder may not {PROHIBITIONSLANG}. The ownership of Severed Property and license shall be managed and represented amongst the parties through the minting of a token on the Designated Blockchain Network and shall also include a Cryptographic Hash Function to map the executed document using IPFS of this executed Agreement.

**Term** 
This License shall be for a term of {TERM}. This License shall automatically expire at the end of the Term, unless both parties agree otherwise.

**License Fee**
The Holder agrees to pay Owner {LICNESEFEE} for the Term of the Agreement.

**Restrictions**
 Holder is expressly prohibited from changing the Real Property in any manner and shall tread lightly. Holder shall permit no liens to be filed against Real Property and Holder shall indemnify and hold Owner and its successors and assigns harmless from and against all costs or expenses of any kind, including but not limited to attorneys&#39; fees, incurred by Owner or its successors or assigns related to any such lien or any notice of intent to file such a lien. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

**Insurance**
 Owner shall not provide insurance for Holder and Owner shall not be liable for damages or injuries caused by or arising from actions or nonactions of the Owner. Holder assumes all risk from actions or inactions on the property and agrees that they will obtain insurance showing evidence of liability coverage for bodily injury, death, and property damage to any person.

**Termination**
 This Agreement is for the sole benefit of Owner and shall not create any easement or other interest in Real Property in favor of Holder. This Agreement and the license granted herein shall not run with the land. Owner may terminate this agreement and the revocable license at any time upon exercise of the Option. Any attempted alienation or assignment without Owner&#39;s consent as provided herein shall be null and void and without legal effect as it is a NON FUNGIBLE token.

**Effect of Termination** 
Upon the termination of this Agreement after Owner excercises the Option or through its natural expiry of the Term the token shall be constructively destroyed (a &quot;Token Burn&quot;), Holder shall no longer have any right to visit the Real Property unless invited.

**Title to Real Property**
 Owner expressly acknowledges and agrees that Owner has good and sufficient title to the Real Property, including but not limited to that portion that is shown on the Site Plan as Severed Property. Holder gains access to and acknowledges that Real Property is taken &quot;As Is&quot; and &quot;With All Faults.&quot; Holder further acknowledges and agrees that the License granted herein is permissive in nature, and Holder waives any and all claims of whatsoever kind or character, including but not limited to claims of adverse possession, to any interest in Real Property arising from or relating in any way to the License granted herein. This Agreement is expressly granted with the understanding that the licensed use shall not constitute adverse possession of any portion of Real Property. This Agreement shall not in any way limit Owner&#39;s ability to license or otherwise dispose of land not subject to the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

**Governing Law**
 Construction of Agreement, and Venue. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of {CHOISE OF LAW AND VENUE}}. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement was produced by arms-length negotiation between sophisticated parties with equal bargaining power. The Parties agree that the rule of construction that any ambiguities are to be construed against the drafting party shall not be employed in any interpretation of this Agreement.

**Entire Agreement**
 Attorneys&#39; Fees. This Agreement constitutes the complete and entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior written or oral negotiations, representations or agreements between the Parties as to the subject matter of this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement may not be modified except by a writing signed by all of the Parties. In any dispute, conflict, legal action or other proceeding arising out of, or brought to construe or enforce any of the provisions of, this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and attorneys&#39; fees from the non-prevailing party. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

**Counterparts; Signatures**
 The parties hereto agree that this Agreement shall be executed via signed transaction on the Designated Blockchain Network through a function call of `transfer()` to the smart contract initiated transfer of the Token from Owner to Holder, and payment of License Fee from Holder to Owner (the &quot;Signature&quot;).
