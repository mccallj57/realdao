THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT OF APPLE TREE (“Agreement”) is made and entered into effective as of April 18, 2021 (“Effective Date”), by and between the owner of real property represented as the holder at Account Address 0xd5B3988eD0AB5ec375E51bB6fd10e205cEC16A2E (“Owner”), and RealDAO, LLC, a Delaware, series LLC. (“Grower”). Owner and Grower are referred to collectively below as the “Parties.”

WHEREAS, Owner is the owner of that real property commonly known as the Howey’s Orchard, (“Real Property”); and

WHEREAS, Grower desires to obtain license to traverse by foot across Real Property to achieve zen and take in tranquility at no cost to Grower; and

WHEREAS, Grower desires to sever and purchase from Owner one apple bearing tree to have and to hold and deworm as desired (“Howey’s Tree”); and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby:
Agree that Howey’s Tree typically considered a fixture and part of the real property, is considered severed by this agreement and shall be considered personal property until which time the Option is exercised and Howey’s Tree merges back with the Real Property,
Consent that the Grower may harvest apples from Howey’s Tree (if any) , 
Consent to the License to access Howey’s Tree, and 
Agree that upon payment of a liquidated amount of 1 xdai, the Grower shall grant said Owner the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase Howey’s Tree at any time thereby revoking the License and this Agreement (the “Option”).  For avoidance of doubt, Howey’s Tree would resume its state as a fixture and part and parcel to the Real Property upon exercise of this option.

Grant of Revocable License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Owner hereby grants to Grower a revocable license for the Term of this Agreement to use that portion of Real Property shown on the Site Plan for the sole use of traversing the Real Property on foot to harvest the tokenized bounty of Howey’s Tree.  It is specifically determined that Grower may not camp on the Real Property nor may they deworm apples on the situs.  The ownership of Howey’s Tree and license shall be managed and represented amongst the parties through the minting of a ERC-721 NFT on the Designated Blockchain Network (the “Token”) and shall also include a  Cryptographic Hash Function to map the executed document using IPFS of the executed Agreement.

Term. This License shall be for a term of two (2) years. This License shall automatically expire at the end of the term, unless both parties agree otherwise.

License Fee. The Grower agrees to pay Owner 1 xDai consideration for the term of the Agreement. 

Restrictions. Grower is expressly prohibited from changing the Real Property any manner and shall tread lightly. Grower shall permit no liens to be filed against Real Property and Grower shall indemnify and hold Owner and its successors and assigns harmless from and against all costs or expenses of any kind, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, incurred by Owner or its successors or assigns related to any such lien or any notice of intent to file such a lien. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Insurance. Owner shall not provide insurance for Grower and Owner shall not be liable for damages or injuries caused by or arising from actions or nonactions of the Owner.  Grower assumes all risk from actions or inactions on the property and agrees that they will obtain insurance showing evidence of liability coverage for bodily injury, death, and property damage to any person. 

Termination. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of Owner and shall not create any easement or other interest in Real Property in favor of Grower. This Agreement and the license granted herein shall not run with the land. Owner may terminate this agreement and the revocable license at any time upon exercise of the “Option.” Any attempted alienation or assignment without Owner’s consent as provided herein shall be null and void and without legal effect as it is a NON FUNGIBLE token.
 
Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement via burning the Token (a “Token Burn”), Grower shall no longer have any right to visit the Real Property unless invited.

Title to Real Property. Owner expressly acknowledges and agrees that Owner has good and sufficient title to the Real Property, including but not limited to that portion that is shown on the Site Plan as Howey’s Tree. Grower gains access to and acknowledges that Real Property is taken “As Is” and “With All Faults.” Grower further acknowledges and agrees that the license granted herein is permissive in nature, and Grower waives any and all claims of whatsoever kind or character, including but not limited to claims of adverse possession, to any interest in Real Property arising from or relating in any way to the license granted herein. This Agreement is expressly granted with the understanding that the licensed use shall not constitute adverse possession of any portion of Real Property. This Agreement shall not in any way limit Owner’s ability to license or otherwise dispose of land not subject to the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

The terms of this Agreement may not be modified except by a writing signed by all of the Parties.

The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Counterparts; Signatures. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement shall be executed via signed transaction on the Designated Blockchain Network through a function call of `transfer()` to the smart contract initiated transfer of the Token from Owner to Grower, and payment of 1xDAI from Grower to Owner (the “Signature”).
